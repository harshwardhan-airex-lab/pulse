"""PULSE PDW (Pulse Descriptor Word) Simulator Implementation.
This module implements a comprehensive PDW simulator for radar-sensor interactions,
providing configurable parameters and realistic error models. It serves as a core
component of the PULSE library for generating synthetic radar data.

The implementation supports:
    - Configurable pulse generation parameters
    - Realistic noise and interference modeling
    - Multiple radar operating modes
    - Time-based pulse sequence generation
    - Statistical error distribution models
    - Custom waveform definitions
    - Batch processing capabilities
    - Real-time data streaming simulation

Key classes:
    - PDWSimulator: Main simulator class for PDW generation
    - RadarModel: Radar characteristics and behavior model
    - ErrorModel: Configurable error and noise injection
